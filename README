This is a quick project used to demostrate the automatic conversion of an object to its json represenation
using the Spring MVC framework. The prject also demostrates a custom serialiser which ignores some of the
attributes of the serialised object.

The specific technologies involved are:

  Spring 4.0.2 (MVC)
  Jackson 2.x

To run the project from the top level directory:

  mvn jetty:run

To test the conversion:

  http://localhost:8090/TestApp/module/{modulecode}

  e.g.:

  http://localhost:8090/TestApp/module/MATHS1001

The resulting json should look something like this:

  {"code":"MATHS1001","results":[{"grade":30.0,"grade":40.0,"grade":5.0}]}
